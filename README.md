# Data Structures and Algorithms Tutorial

This repository is meant as a self-guided exploration of DS and Algorithms implemented in Python3.
We will be exploring rum-time optimizations as well as ways of writing readable and idiomatic code.

We will be using [Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition](https://github.com/CodeClub-JU/Introduction-to-Algorithms-CLRS/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Algorithms%20-%203rd%20Edition.pdf) as our companion textbook.

## Setup

```shell script
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ds_tutorial
```
