# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

Algorithm: Any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values,
as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**.

Data Structure: A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
